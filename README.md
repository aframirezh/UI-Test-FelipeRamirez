# UI-Test-FelipeRamirez

Progress-bar: For the progress bar I would use a the state of the component to render the progress of the votes taking into account the local storage
Reactive button tacking into account votes: I would add function to watch the state of the progress bar
I would improve the UI test adding some more validation to the rendering process
I would improve the mobile view to render in a better way the images of cards
I would add the image above the footer as a new section to add the possibility to submit a new card
I would improve the message below the closing in days counter to reorder the page when the notification is closed
I would add a new react component to make the counter of the 22 days dynamic
